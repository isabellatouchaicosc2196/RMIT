Interest in IT- In the current world, business and employment relies on technology. My passion for IT developed during high school when we did IT as a subject for an elective. The most useful subject which highlighted the value of understanding principle elements of information technology. Corona Virus was a huge wave of destruction for older and small businesses who were not as advanced in technology to keep up to date and run their business online. My father carried a career in IT as head of business enhancement in an insurance company for 15 years. I followed his path of interest in being tech savvy such as being able to fix technical problems, issues with computers and technology which sparked my interest. RMIT holds a high reputation for information technology and mathematics so I decided to study this subject with RMIT in order to gain the most understanding and quality knowledge of technology. My cousin in Melbourne graduated from RMIT last year so she spoke highly of the university which sparked my interest to study information technology with them. ","3 I expect to learn the principles and major elements of IT, the history of where IT was established and the core factors of the valuable knowledge in IT.

This outlines my strengths and personality type. Influence of Results in Team ","5 The results form a personal identity of myself for learning, creating and participating in a group. Utilising the strengthens and understanding the results aids the value I can add in a group or personal aspect. Forming a Team Using the Results By complimenting each other’s personality elements, a group can benefit from an overall perspective to complete the assignments to obtain a high grade.

TEST 1- Myers-Briggs Test TEST 2- Online Learning Test- Education Planner ","6 TEST 3- Psychometric test ","7 Project Idea- I would like to develop a smartphone app compatible for a majority of different users. Develop an app that runs a program of your perfect day. The user answers different tests, fills in details about their interests, where they like to go . The app uses this data to form ‘the perfect day’ for the user. The app would provide nearby locations, activities, recommendations and inputs for the user to go to or follow. This app would aid the routine of a perfect day which satisfies the experience of the user. People desire perfection and ease so an app that provides inputs and recommendations customised for the suer may surge excitement. A drawback may be that the app follows user input at the time of setting it up. On an average day the user starts to use the app, they may have dissatisfaction from the recommendations due to their mood or experience of a location, activity or routine. This may cause dissatisfaction of the user which may cause disconnection. ","8 Passion in IT and Innovation- I am passionate about psychology and the human experience. Why and how people do things intrigues me as there is a real life background code for all experiences. For example, someone with childhood trauma can experience negative impacts in their adulthood such as distancing themselves from close ones due to fear of being hurt. From observation, technology advancement has slowed down in compared to discoveries back in the 1900s. I would like to witness personalised IT components intergraded into our daily life such as to ease our travel time, work load or household tasks using apps or devices. An innovative IT method to develop the required skills, experience and knowledge to be qualified for an ideal job would be an electronic guide that is filled with the relevant checklist to accomplish the goal of getting the dream job. Using input of experienced professionals in the role, the electronic guide could provide tutorials and tasks for the individual to go through in order to make their way up towards the role. All the required education requirements would need to be ticked off, relevant skills need to be learnt and tasks need to be fulfilled in order for a person to be able to apply for the role once they gain the preliminary experience. This would allow the participant to prepare for the role while outlining they have gained and received the relevant requirements to successfully fulfil it. The electronic guide could be interested into the resume of the individual when applying for the role. Overview Develop an app that runs a program of your perfect day. The user answers different tests, fills in details about their interests, where they like to go. The app uses this data to form ‘the perfect day’ for the user. The app would provide nearby locations, activities, recommendations and inputs for the user to go to or follow. This app would aid the routine of a perfect day which satisfies the experience of the user. People desire perfection and ease so an app that provides inputs and recommendations customised for the suer may surge excitement. Motivation ","9 I have basked in my moments of perfection some days where everything goes right and all activities are enjoyable. I want to form this feeling into a working device to form an innovative app that provides this feeling to its users. Description The app would be downloaded and customised by the user. It would start off with obtaining basic fact find details and running different quizzes to form a profile as well as identity of the user to provide optimum experience for them. Using tools and features, the app would be unique to form a timeline of ‘to dos’ and places for the user to go to such as a café or museum that the app thinks the user would enjoy the most depending on their budget, current weather and personality. So at a time when the user cannot decide what or where they want to go, the app forms a map and details of recommended places for the perfect experience. Tools and Technologies Mobile app platforms can assist with the creation of the app. Understanding different platforms and having the skills for HTML, XML and language coding would help form the app and necessary functions. Skills Required The certain skills required in order to design and run the functioning app include programming skills, app concept development, backend coding and business abilities to promote the app. The IT and business side of an idea go hand in hand. This is due to the fact that the app needs IT programming as well as knowledge, the app also needs business skills to promote the sales of the app which is the end goal of most app developer’s team. Outcome The outcome of the successful life of the app, would allow the users to enjoy a perfect and joyful day using the software’s inputs. ","10 Offering a pleasurable experience for the users to enjoy a perfect day with the help of formulated ‘perfect outcomes’ for events and activities. This would help take the burden of deciding where to go and what to do for a day off or weekend. Savouring the valuable minimum time for enjoying their time with family or friends using the scripted as well as tailored preferences. "]
