<p style='margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-family: "Times New Roman";'>I was born in Sydney, Australia. &nbsp;I am currently obtaining my Bachelor of Laws and I have two certificates in finance. Specifically, a Diploma of financial planning and Derivates Certificate. I am bilingual so I can speak fluent Persian and English. I have a gorgeous kitty named Edwina and she is a domestic short hair who we adopted from an animal shelter one year ago. An interesting fact about myself is I started working in finance from the age 15 for my family&rsquo;s business. The hobbies that I enjoy are photography, psychology and skateboarding.&nbsp;</p>
